Things I learned:\
-Basics of local storage so data is not lost on page refresh\
-Gained a deeper understanding of the concept of Event Propagation; What is meant when a event bubbles and when it trickles.\
-How to properly use Event Delegation 
-You can access DOM elements with a variable refrencing that DOM elements ID,Class,Attribute.
-You can add event listeners INSIDE of other functions.\
-`!` NOT will turn truthy values falsey and falsey values truthy. You can change a variable/value using `!`
-Learned the basics of JSON, like how you can convert a JS object/arrary `JSON.stringify(myObj)` into a string, and convert it back into a object/arrary `JSON.parse(myJSON)` again.
